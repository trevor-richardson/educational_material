1) clean up code for inv_kin_closed_form_arm -- do this last -- heni needs to send me his pictures
2) build data generator for training algorithm (Done)
3) Create dropout histogram -- visualization
    -- update to using GPU acceleration
    -- update to visualize results
4) create two training methods for two different classification or clustering and regression
5) Build an imitation learning simulation (version 1 -- bugs)
    -- lets generate some desired location
    -- only world if I put my mouse where the hand is
    -- collect data
    -- training algorithm for lstm
    -- execute function approximator
6) custom implementation of lstm built for training. I'm assuming that different length sequences will be present
